## 📖 What is Archyve?

Archyve started as a simple browser extension to help users access research papers via open directories — right from their browser. It offered ease, speed, and a developer-friendly way to maximize productivity.  

However, **we've evolved**.

We're now building **Archyve v1** — a permissionless, decentralized platform where:

- **Researchers own their content**.
- **Contributors are incentivized** on-chain.
- **Research is freely accessible**, verified, and immutable.

This README reflects the original version for reference purposes only.

## 🛠️ What Did Archyve v0 Do?

> A simple Chromium-based dev tool to quickly open academic content through Sci-Hub or known open-access directories.

### 🧩 Features

- 🔗 **Right-click context menu**: Open any selected research paper link directly.
- 🖱️ **Icon Click**: One-click access to open current tab in Sci-Hub.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl + Shift + H` for instant access.
- ⚙️ **Options Page**:
  - Enable/disable hotkeys
  - Set your preferred Sci-Hub domain
  - Toggle icon behavior

## 🚫 Why We No Longer Support Sci-Hub Access

While we respect the mission of open knowledge, **Sci-Hub operates in legal gray zones** and is not a sustainable or compliant approach for global academic access.  

**Archyve's future is open, legal, and decentralized.** We're transitioning toward a **Web3-native infrastructure** where authors can:

- Publish verified research on-chain  
- Monetize or license their work openly  
- Build profiles and credibility as researchers  

---

## 🚀 What's Coming in Archyve v1
We're in active development for:

### 🌐 Web3 Research Protocol  
An onchain, censorship-resistant protocol where:

- 🧑‍🔬 **Researchers can build open profiles**  
- 📤 **Submit and verify their original research**  
- 📥 **Community-driven validation and review**  
- 🎁 **Token-based incentives** for publishers and curators  
- 🔍 **Public, trustless search index** across verified materials

### 📦 Modular Features (Upcoming)

- ⚡ Upload-to-chain flow (IPFS + smart contract metadata)
- ✅ Zero-knowledge verification pipeline for academic legitimacy
- 🔗 Identity linking (ORCID, Lens profiles, etc.)
